      <description>A writer on different topics I&amp;rsquo;m a son of two and employer of one.
I like explore the open source space and test the different interesting applications one could use. A lot of them extremely useful &amp;amp; practical and others simply fun and interesting.
I&amp;rsquo;m also a hobbyist moonshiner with 4 years of random blends and experiments, a Coen Brothers fanatic, and a football (soccer) lunatic.</description>
