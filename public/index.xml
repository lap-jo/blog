      <description>A little introduction So, I recently switched to i3wm and ran into a small issue with running virt-manager from the desktop entry. Turns out, I need root access for it to work. In my previous setup with Fedora GNOME, I would simply get a password prompt with polkit-gnome. Running it in the terminal without root gives me the No Polkit Authentication error after it fails.&#xA;Why do I get the &amp;ldquo;No Polkit Authentication Agent&amp;rdquo; error?</description>

This is very useful as it reduces battery usage incase you unknowingly forgot to turn off your computer before a long trip or in any other situation.&#xA;But There are situations where you will want this behaviour changed so that you can tasks running with the lid closed.</description>
