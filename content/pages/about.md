# A writer on different topics

I'm a son of two and employer of one.

I like explore the open source space and test the different interesting applications
one could use. A lot of them extremely useful & practical and others simply fun 
and interesting.

I'm also a hobbyist moonshiner with 4 years of random blends and experiments, a 
Coen Brothers fanatic, and a football (soccer) lunatic.
