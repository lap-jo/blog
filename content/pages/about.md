I'm lapjo and this is my blog.

the goal is to write whatever I feel like on a given day, it could be a how to,
a poem, random blubberings, anything.

who I am is not particularly important, but I hope what I write will entertain
or at the bare minimum bore you. 

As I'd rather you remember my article as the one that bored you to death, let my legacy.
