# I'm am lapjo & this is my personal site
I am a managing director at [Jojo Waragi](https://jojowaragi.com). The contents
of this site though are not in affiliation with my employer even if I will be 
writing about them here.

I have a passion for distilling spirits but also simply blending spirits & 
different essential oils to produce great tasting moonshines.

I will be writing about some of these explorations here. I also love the 
opensource space, hence I will be writing about software for linux and other 
opensource one's.

This same sight will act as a brain-dump of sort for ideas I have. feel free to 
contribute (although it's possible that by the time you read this I won't have
set up the disqus serve)
