My first encounter with nuclear music player was in May 2022, when I was running
ubuntu on a virtual machine as I was still a windows user at the time. The experience 
was painful to say the least.

It would take ages for songs to be fetched, the playlist functionality was clanky.
But a lot of these problems were mostly due to the project being new and having 
a lot of bugs. At the time I was looking for an alternative to spotify and the other
services like spotify on the pc. I knew it was already a matter of time as there
are free and opensource application for android that do exactly what nuclear does
and the only reason they were in development earlier was only the fact that they 
are on the most widely used operating system and linux derivative, they all started 
with these many bugs and got polished up with time.

So I knew with time due to greater support and the sheer stubbornness of the 
project creators the project would improve. So I stuck around testing every updated
version over the months and years. And I can confidently say that the nuclear
music player is the best music streaming application for linux and windows.

It has most of the useful features that are on it's proprietary counterparts, like
creating playlists, fetching and displaying lyrics, track your listening habits
with by connecting to your last.fm account (this information is stored locally on
your computer). While also being secure &  having no trackers or ads.

### the creator
Like I hinted earlier, about the creator having a good sense of humor here is a
link to the official website for the nuclear music player project.

It features great testimonials about the project from supposed artistes and
programmers. I'm no legal expert on music publishing and distribution so I'll leave
