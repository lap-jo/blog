You have just powered on your laptop to get some work done, or to watch your favourite
tv show. The button light is on, the fan is running, but the screen is black.

You panick, 'do I have to replace the screen?', 'do I need a new laptop?', 'if it was
provided by your employer, will it be removed from your salary'.

Well relax, as in this article I'll explain possible causes for you problem and
give solutions.

First & foremost, the particular problem I present is very particular in that it
happens when the PC was in the off state, you turn it on but the screen won't 
display anything.

There are many other variations with differing fixes but in this article I will
focus on this particular one.

## Possible Causes
1. Software & driver malfunctions - you hardware and software communicate on a 
   given set of rules for normal processes to occur. \
   Unfortunately, sometimes things do go as planned probably because of changes
   made either by the user by some software on the pc, like a windows update or even 
   malware.
2. Hardware Issues - this is can be loose connections to display display adaptors
, dead harddrives, among others.

## Solution
1. I have done a fair bit of research on the topic and there are a number of 
   solutions given on technology forums all of them seemingly good. But the one
   solution that seems to fix the issue atleast temporarily is by resetting the 
   pc's peripherals.
- These are the steps you will take;
  - power off your pc
