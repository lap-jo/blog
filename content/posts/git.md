git is a distribution revision control system. Created by programming penguin  
Linus Torvalds probably in a few days -*who knows I've done no research for this 
article*. 

This is a little write up on the only git commands you need. It is also by no means
a list of the only commands you need to know just the only one's you need to use *mostly*.

This is also a masterclass on how not to write.

well git is a version control system created by Linus Torvalds because at the time
most of the other version control systems sucked. He also created linux cause he 
was too broke to afford a $15000 pc. There's your history.

I can't believe I'm actually going to post this article, what even am I doing with 
my life. on a more serious note though
```bash 
git push -f
```
is the command that forces your file changes to be sent to wherever you keep them.
Yes sometimes things go wrong and for whatever reason you can't push your files
because certain constraints haven't been met. well you can just push that shit
and if you break something with this commit then your fucked but atleast you've 
broken it on your own terms.

PS: this article is for people who already use git. Also the article ends here.

This is a cry for help.
