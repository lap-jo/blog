I may be addicted to alcohol
Not sure yet
but the thoughts have been brewing
the signs are there

Have a sip on thursday afternoon
And by days-end will be on about 
8 pints
Plus a few whiskys to wash it down

I tell myself "only one last time"
but will complain to the 
bartender next time 
when there's only one beer left

I've tried leaving it for a week
only to fall back to it
tried switching from nile special
to one of the lites
But the current seems to 
drive me back to the 
river

this is only the drinking though
the social mental repurcusions
are a force to reckon with
there's no sleep for the beerholder
workout routine is in pits

I don't have a crazy libido
I'd infact say it's less than
for the average person
On the brew though I'll eat anything
