## A command-line based file manager for the power user(kind of)
Ranger is a free and opensource versatile file manager designed for the command-line
. It provides a user-friendly interface for efficiently navigating, manipulating, and
organizing files and directories on linux. Ranger is also vim inspired and uses 
vim keybindings, this was one of the main reasons I started using it.

Developed by Roman Zimbelmann ranger offers features like customizable keybindings
and file previewing, making it a preferred choice for tech enthusiasts and
power users seeking an effective and streamlined file management solution.
