# Introduction
- ncmpcpp is a frontend for Music Player Daemon (MPD). MPD is a music player 
  server that plays and organises audio files, playlists, etc.
- to interact (in a user friendly manner) with MPD we need a client application
and ncmpcpp is one of these application.
- ncmpcpp is a fork of ncmpc that comes with many more features including but not
limited to visualizer, tag editor, playlist editor, lyrics display and download.
- ncmpcpp is a terminal based application

## Install ncmpcpp & Mpd
- ncmpcpp is available on most linux distribution repositories. In my case I use
**Fedora Linux** so I use the following command;
```bash
sudo dnf5 install mpd ncmpcpp
``` 
for Debian-based 'ubuntu, linux mint, etc' distros;
```bash
sudo apt-get install mpd ncmpcpp
```
## configuring MPD
- we will create a configuration file in **.config/mpd/mpd.conf**, this file 
will override the default system-wide configuration.
```bash
touch .config/mpd/mpd.conf
```
- you can also use **.mpd/mpd.conf** 
```bash
touch .mpd/mpd.conf
```

here is my configuration file;
```bash
   1   | music_directory     "/home/user/Music"
   2   │ playlist_directory  "/home/user/.config/mpd/playlists"
   3   │ 
   4   │ auto_update "yes"
   5   │ bind_to_address "127.0.0.1"
   6   │ restore_paused "yes"
   7   │ max_output_buffer_size "16384"
   8   │ 
   9   │ audio_output {
  10   │     type "pulse"
  11   │     name "pulse"
  12   │     #type  "alsa"
  13   │     #name  "ALSA"
  14   │ }
  15   │ 
  16   │ audio_output {
  17   │        type "fifo"
  18   │        name "Visualizer feed"
  19   │        path "/tmp/mpd.fifo"
  20   │        format   "44100:16:2"
  21   │ }
```
Replace ***user*** with your username

In the **audio_output** option I have set *type* and *name* to pulse because I am 
using pulseaudio as my output source. you can switch to alsa instead.

---
**NOTE:** There are many more options than this & you can explore them in **/etc/mpd.conf** \
You will also find explanations for each option in the same file. 
**DO NOT MAKE DIRECT CHANGES TO THIS FILE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING**

## configuring ncmpcpp
- we will create a configuration file in **.config/ncmpcpp/config**, this file 

```bash
vim .config/ncmpcpp/config
```

- now we add the configuration content
```bash
   1   │ ncmpcpp_directory = ~/.config/ncmpcpp
   2   │ lyrics_directory = ~/.lyrics
   3   │ mpd_music_dir = ~/Music
   4   │ mpd_crossfade_time = 12
   5   │ visualizer_look = ^|
   6   │ visualizer_spectrum_smooth_look = no 
   7   │ execute_on_song_change = herbe "Now Playing" "$(mpc --format '%title% \n%artist% - %album%' current)" 
   8   │ playlist_display_mode = columns
   9   │ browser_display_mode = columns
  10   │ search_engine_display_mode = columns
  11   │ playlist_editor_display_mode = columns
  12   │ progressbar_look = **
  13   │ user_interface = alternative
  14   │ media_library_albums_split_by_date = no
  15   │ statusbar_visibility = no
  16   │ connected_message_on_startup = no
  17   │ lyrics_fetchers = musixmatch, genius, azlyrics
  18   │ fetch_lyrics_for_current_song_in_background = yes
  19   │ store_lyrics_in_song_dir = no 
  20   │ screen_switcher_mode = playlist, browser, lyrics
  21   │ startup_screen = playlist
  22   │ jump_to_now_playing_song_at_start = yes
  23   │ display_bitrate = yes
  24   │ external_editor = nvim
  25   │ header_window_color = default
  26   │ color2 = green
```

---
**NOTE:** for *execute_on_song_change* you will need to download herbe 
```bash
sudo dnf5 install herbe
```
---

## Startup 
First we start mpd
```bash
mpd
```
Then we start ncmpcpp
```bash
ncmpcpp
```

## Lets explore ncmpcpp
### this is the playlist screen
<figure>
<img src="/images/ncmpcpp_current_playlist.webp" width="cover" alt="ncmpcpp playlist screen">
<figcation>Fig.1 - ncmpcpp playlist view</figcation>
</figure>

On startup of ncmcpp you will be greeted by the current playlist display. To navigate 
here from other areas use Press **1**

Press **u** to update the database so your audio files are visible to ncmpcpp

### media library
<figure>
<img src="/images/ncmpcpp_media_lib.webp" width="cover" alt="ncmpcpp playlist screen">
<figcation>Fig.2 - ncmpcpp media library</figcation>
</figure>

This is the ncmpcpp media library. Press **4** to navigate to this screen.
As you can see in Fig.2 the Albums are sorted by artist, to sort by date press
**4** again

### lyrics view
<figure>
<img src="/images/ncmpcpp_lyrics.webp" width="cover" alt="ncmpcpp playlist screen">
<figcation>Fig.2.1 - ncmpcpp lyrics view with lyrics to MF DOOM's "Korn Karne"</figcation>
</figure>

One of the features of ncmpcpp is the ability to download and view lyrics. To switch
to this view press **l** with the selection on the song whose lyrics you want to 
view.

Come to think of it ncmpcpp may be the best way to get lyrics for any song on linux.

You press **F** to toggle fetching lyrics on song change.


### visualizer
<figure>
<img src="/images/ncmpcpp_visualizer.webp" width="cover" alt="ncmpcpp playlist screen">

</figure>

Ncmpcpp comes with a visualizer which can be access by pressing **8**. We can configure
its look in the ncmpcpp config.



## Conclusion
There it is that is enough to get you started with ncmpcpp. For more ricing options
you can visit forums such as r/unixporn on reddit, search for ncmpcpp dotfiles
off of github and gitlab.

For a comprehensive list of keybindings visit [ncmpcpp cheatsheet]("https://pkgbuild.com/~jelle/ncmpcpp/")

For more configuration options see the ncmpcpp man pages with
