## Stremio a crossplatform media player

Stremio is a linux media player whose functionality can be extended to give it 
many more features and even turn it into a full streaming service.

It is crossplatform with clients for linux, windows, macOS, androidTV, and 
also mobile clients for android, and *iOS- with limited functionality*.

Pros
- Cross Platform
- Modern Clean Interface
- Extensibility with it's addons features
- Large community making support easy to find

Cons
- limited functionality for ios client

### The vegies

I know you're as confused as I am with the number of streaming services available,
they seem to pop every other weekend with certain shows and films limited to only
a few of them. For my hook-handed friends out there this is no problem but for 
you, yes you the simple normie filled with naivety and have already bowed to the 
pressure and decided to pay for all 10 streaming services or sadly have ended up 
having to forfeit certain movies cause you only pay for netflix and a few seasons 
of breaking bad have not yet hit the provider. 

Well fear not as there is a solution to all your problems, **Stremio**. With very
little hacking  -no hacking you'll be able to watch all your favourite shows and 
movies in one platform for free. Yes free as in freedom and also free as in money **remember 
though it's no crime to support the good developers who have given you this application**
as it brings down your oportunity cost tenfold.

### features in depth

I know you must be wondering why I keep calling stremio a media player. Well that's
because that's what it really is at the start a simple media player.

But with the help of plugins you could get it to be more than that. A few official
plugins and a lot of community plugins.
