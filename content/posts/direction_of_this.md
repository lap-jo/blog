I have been watching youtube videos from creator *luke smith* on youtube and have \
noticed that he will sometimes randomly not post anything for really long periods \
-a whole year.

It is actually quite interesting to me because I only ever notice a long time \
he actually posting which is not really the same with other creators and it's led \
to go back and watch some of he's content to understand why and I don't actually \
understand why till now. But I have actually realised that whenever I watch a \
*luke smith* video it's not actually because I have typed **lukesmith** into the \
youtube search bar, but rather when I search for certain content I'm interested\
in shows up.

This is mostly instructional content on linux, and sometimes just some phylosophical \
stuff. He's trick seems to be to create content on things that interest him, without \
a care for what he's audience thinks of him.

he is like a bearblog writer but on youtube. he's content is not motivated by \ 
pleasing an audience or monetary gain -atleast on youtube. Just expressing he's \ 
raw thoughts and showing off the new things he's learnt to do and maybe believes \
other should be doing.

since I created this site I have been lost on what to write about and this has \
been due to a number of reasons one being that I have never actually written for \
and audience before and even crucial that I have never written for myself. So I \
started writing for you my audience without learning how to write personal texts \
leading me to try and write text to impress people I don't even know, writing \
with the hope that I will see monetary gains which isn't a bad thing but has made \
it more stressful and my content very generic). Although considering I have been \
writing how tos that is probably what the content should be, *generic*

that's all I have to say to be fair. have a nice day and I hope I wasted your \
time. also my future posts will be more like this, random, nonsensicle and hopefuly\
sometimes useful.
