## Private frontends to popular social media websites

These sites and apps are alternative frontends for popular social media sites like twitter,
youtube, reddit, among others.

They basically fetch their feeds from these sites
and serve them to you without the trackers and advertising giving you a distruction-free
and privacy respecting experience

These are not actual alternatives like the Mastodons, and LBRYs of this world. I
hope to post about these in future

## Twitter Frontends
**1. Nitter**

 Nitter is an alternative private twitter front-end created by programmer
 [Zedeus](https://github.com/zedeus).
 
 Nitter eliminates all the annoying ads and javascript. With no javascript 
 fingerprinting & IP tracking are eliminated making your online activity more
 anonymous.
 
 Another advantage of using nitter is that there is no need to login to view 
 content which is a very big inconviniece especially if you only clicked an 
 embedded tweet on an external website and only wanted to view the content of 
 that particular tweet.
 

 
 At this time nitter lacks a system to subscribe to particular accounts and
 have a feed with these accounts.
