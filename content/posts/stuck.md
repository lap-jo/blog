Life can sometimes deal us an unfavorable hand, and it's during these times that
we must choose to confront our circumstances head-on or risk falling into a cycle
of regret. I've recently faced a period of stagnation, which led to feelings of
uncertainty and inaction. However, I've come to realize that taking a step back
to reevaluate and strategize is essential for personal growth.

In my journey, I've neglected responsibilities, such as not completing two
certificate exams I've paid for and neglecting my businesses and family time. I
found myself merely going through the motions, and before I knew it, hours would
pass by unnoticed.

Acknowledging that I'm not alone in this struggle, I'm determined to rise above
it and regain control of my life. As an African man with an upbringing that 
encourages stoicism, I've often suppressed my emotions to maintain a strong 
facade. However, I now understand the importance of vulnerability and addressing
my feelings to break free from the rut I'm in.

Taking actionable steps towards change, I'm working on identifying my priorities,
setting achievable goals, and fostering open communication with my loved ones.
As of now I found someone to talk to about how I feel and what was bugging me, this
has helped a lot but there is still a long way to go but atleast steps are being
taken. I am still not fully comfortable with laying out my problems as I feel like
I could be burdenning this person with my issues small or big but what got me 
into that bad place exactly this -thinking that I will just ignore my feelings 
and get on with life. I've learnt the hardway that that shit will eventually catch 
up with you and so it's best to just let it out and see what next.

If you are going through shit and need someone to vent to I'm here for you just 
hit me up on any of my socials. This is also a good time to announce that I'm 
going to rollout comment support for this website also looking for collaborators
interested in writing about various topics mainly technology in a variety of medium
like sport, education and what not.
