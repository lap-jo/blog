she was the finest nurse around,
she sat at her table, I drowned in her
gaze.

held my arm, your brown eyes
Search,
As fingers run over my 
veins.

She's mastered this maze...
Jessica.
she's taken though,
Indulge
So i can't, 

for me listening is enough
the allure of your beauty,
was only for one moment
For once she spoke

I'd arrive at her work,
at 3pm atleast 3 days a week
We'd just talk, Well
She did all of the talking.

I was sucked in, I would just sit
as she bombarded me,
with tales from her past.
Dropping little crumbs
about the now
hinting to tomorrow,

she delivered the news
about her change of workplacee
as a doctor would,
break
bad news.

You showed me a picture
Of your mom, And went into
stories of your childhood

It was always easy to start
Conversations with her
Ending them though
This was the case with 
every woman I loved.

I always felt like I left you wanting
left you disappointed
And then I would'nt talk
Until I showed up at your work

This is tiring
but the faults not yours
