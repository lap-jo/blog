For a really long time 

I haven't cried or shown

any real emotion

it's still difficult even to this day

last week I had a moment though

___

opened up -only as much as I could

to someone I genuinely trust

was in tears the whole time too

even though it was via text

___

It felt like a breakthrough, infact it was a great moment

but I believe I still held back so much even if said person "we'll call them beth" was and probably is more than willing 

to listen and help me.
