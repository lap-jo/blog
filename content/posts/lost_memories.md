2014, 14 year old me to my brother: remember we used to play space chimp on ps2?.
He had no recallection of it whatsoever, infact none of my 3 older
brothers remembered ever owning the game.

I am fairly certain to this day that we infact played it.

I'm sure this hasn't only happened to me. Is there a word for it?, are there 
publications explaining or atleast trying to explain this.

Is it possible that one memory shared by 4 or more people can only be remembered
by one? Do we sometimes makeup memories unintentionally, and if so how does one
determine if it's made up or not.

Next Vsauce publication should probably be on this. In the meanwhile, I'll bore
myself with written publications

also why does the comment plugin I use on neovim not differentiate between a line
of pure markdown and a hugo shortcode

I have also not once googled to find out if there was actually a space chimp game
on ps2. So may be I should.
